# Admin Authentication Restoration Guide

This document explains how to restore the temporarily disabled admin authentication functionality.

## What Was Disabled

The admin login functionality has been temporarily disabled to allow unrestricted access to the admin interface during development. All authentication-related code has been preserved with clear comments for easy restoration.

## Files Modified

### Frontend Files

1. **`frontend/middleware/auth-admin.js`**

   - Authentication middleware bypassed
   - Original code preserved in comments

2. **`frontend/pages/admin/index.vue`**

   - Authentication headers removed from API calls
   - Middleware dependency commented out
   - Original code preserved in comments

3. **`frontend/pages/admin/login.vue`**
   - Renamed to `login.vue.disabled` to prevent routing
   - File preserved completely intact

### Backend Files

4. **`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/dataset_management.py`**
   - Admin authentication dependencies commented out
   - Import statement disabled
   - All endpoint authentication removed

## How to Restore Authentication

### Step 1: Restore Frontend Authentication

1. **Restore middleware (`frontend/middleware/auth-admin.js`)**:

   ```javascript
   // Remove the bypass code and uncomment the original authentication logic
   export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {
   	// Check if user is authenticated and has admin role
   	const authToken = useCookie("auth-token");
   	const userRole = useCookie("user-role");

   	if (!authToken.value) {
   		return navigateTo("/auth/login");
   	}

   	if (userRole.value !== "admin") {
   		throw createError({
   			statusCode: 403,
   			statusMessage: "Access denied. Admin privileges required.",
   		});
   	}
   });
   ```

2. **Restore admin page authentication (`frontend/pages/admin/index.vue`)**:

   - Uncomment the middleware in `definePageMeta`
   - Restore authentication headers in all API calls
   - Uncomment the auto-redirect functionality

3. **Restore login page**:
   ```bash
   mv frontend/pages/admin/login.vue.disabled frontend/pages/admin/login.vue
   ```

### Step 2: Restore Backend Authentication

1. **Restore imports (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/dataset_management.py`)**:

   ```python
   from app.core.auth import get_current_admin_user
   ```

2. **Restore all endpoint dependencies**:
   - Uncomment all `current_user: dict = Depends(get_current_admin_user)` parameters
   - Ensure proper comma placement in function signatures

### Step 3: Test Authentication

1. Restart both frontend and backend servers
2. Navigate to `/admin` - should redirect to login
3. Test login with admin credentials
4. Verify admin interface access is restricted to authenticated admin users

## Quick Restoration Commands

For quick restoration, search and replace the following patterns:

**Frontend:**

```bash
# Restore middleware
sed -i 's|// middleware: \'auth-admin\'|middleware: \'auth-admin\'|g' frontend/pages/admin/index.vue

# Restore login page
mv frontend/pages/admin/login.vue.disabled frontend/pages/admin/login.vue
```

**Backend:**

```bash
# Restore import
sed -i 's|# from app.core.auth import get_current_admin_user|from app.core.auth import get_current_admin_user|g' backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/dataset_management.py

# Restore dependencies (manual review recommended)
```

## Notes

- All original authentication logic is preserved in comments
- No authentication code was deleted, only commented out
- The admin interface remains fully functional during the disabled state
- All API endpoints continue to work without authentication
- Vector database synchronization and other features remain active

## Security Reminder

**Important**: Remember to restore authentication before deploying to production environments. The current state allows unrestricted access to admin functionality.
