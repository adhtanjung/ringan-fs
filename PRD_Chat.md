### **2. User Personas & Goals**

- **The Overwhelmed Student:** A college student experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety due to academic pressure, social adjustments, and future uncertainties. They are hesitant to seek traditional therapy due to stigma and cost. Their primary goal is to find immediate, private, and actionable coping mechanisms to manage their anxiety.

- **The Stressed Professional:** A working adult juggling a demanding career and family responsibilities, leading to feelings of burnout and stress. They have limited time for scheduled appointments and are looking for a flexible way to decompress and learn stress management techniques. Their goal is to have a readily available tool to help them navigate workplace and personal stressors.

- **The Curious Individual:** Someone who is not experiencing a crisis but is interested in improving their overall mental well-being and emotional resilience. They are looking for a tool to understand their emotions better and learn proactive mental health strategies. Their goal is to engage in self-exploration and personal growth in a structured and informative way.

### **3. Functional Requirements**

#### **3.1. Chat Consultation**

The core of the app is an intelligent chat interface that provides a safe and supportive space for users to express themselves.

- **3.1.1. Onboarding & Initial Interaction:**

  - Upon first use, the app will present a brief and welcoming onboarding sequence explaining its purpose and limitations, including a clear disclaimer that it is not a replacement for professional medical advice or therapy.
  - Users will have the option to start a conversation immediately without needing to self-diagnose.
  - Optionally, users can select a broad category of concern (e.g., Stress, Anxiety, Trauma) to help the AI focus the initial conversation. A "Not Sure" option will also be available.

- **3.1.2. AI-Powered Assessment:**

  - The AI will be designed to understand and interpret natural language input, including colloquialisms and nuanced emotional expressions. It will use sentiment analysis to gauge the user's emotional state.
  - The AI will initiate a conversation to understand the user's feelings and the context of their distress. The goal is to identify the underlying problem (e.g., "Stress from Relationships," "Social Anxiety").
  - If the user's initial input is unclear, the AI will ask clarifying open-ended questions to gather more information before attempting to categorize the problem.

- **3.1.3. Structured Assessment Flow:**

  - Once the AI has a preliminary understanding of the problem (maps to a `sub_category_id`), it will begin a structured assessment based on the "1.2 Self Assessment" dataset.
  - The AI will ask questions sequentially as defined by the `next_step` column.
  - The `response_type` (e.g., scale, text) will determine the expected user input format.
  - The conversation will continue until the assessment for a particular problem cluster is complete (reaches an `end_assess` or similar logical endpoint).

- **3.1.4. Suggestion and Intervention Delivery:**

  - Upon completing an assessment cluster, the AI will provide relevant suggestions based on the "1.3 Suggestions" dataset, matched by `sub_category_id` and `cluster`.
  - Suggestions will be presented in a clear, concise, and empathetic manner.
  - Where applicable, `resource_link`s will be provided for further reading or external tools.

- **3.1.5. Feedback and Iteration:**
  - After a suggestion is provided, the AI will use prompts from the "1.4 Feedback Prompts" dataset to gauge the effectiveness of the suggestion.
  - The user's feedback will determine the `next_action` based on the logic in the "1.5 Next Action After Feedback" dataset (e.g., `continue_same`, `show_problem_menu`).

#### **3.2. Knowledge Base / Dataset Management**

A secure and user-friendly web-based portal will be created for administrators and mental health professionals to manage the application's knowledge base.

- **3.2.1. Dataset Management Interface:**

  - The system will provide a clear and intuitive interface to view, add, edit, and delete entries in all the underlying datasets ("1.1 Problems" through "1.6 FineTuning Examples").
  - The interface should support easy data entry, potentially through a spreadsheet-like grid or form-based inputs.
  - Data validation will be implemented to ensure data integrity (e.g., correct ID formats, required fields are not empty).

- **3.2.2. Data Import/Export:**
  - The system will allow for the bulk import and export of data in CSV or Excel format to facilitate easy updates and backups.

### **4. Data Model & Storage**

The current spreadsheet-based data structure provides a solid foundation. To enhance scalability and relational integrity, the following improvements are recommended:

#### **4.1. Proposed Data Model Enhancements**

- **Unified `problems` Table:** Combine the "1.1 Problems" sheets from all Excel files into a single, unified table with a consistent structure.
- **Clear Foreign Key Relationships:** Enforce foreign key constraints between tables to ensure data consistency. For example, `sub_category_id` in the "Self Assessment" table should directly link to a `sub_category_id` in the "Problems" table.
- **Improved `next_action` Logic:** The `next_action` column in "1.4 Feedback Prompts" should be standardized to link directly to `action_id` in "1.5 Next Action After Feedback" for clearer, machine-readable logic.
- **"1.6 FineTuning Examples" Enhancement:** Add a `user_intent` column to better categorize the prompts for more effective model fine-tuning.

#### **4.2. Recommended Database Technology**

A hybrid approach utilizing both a **Vector Database** and a **NoSQL Database** is recommended to leverage the strengths of each for different aspects of the application.

- **Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus):**

  - **Use Case:** The primary function of the vector database will be to power the initial, open-ended part of the conversation. User inputs will be converted into vector embeddings, and a similarity search will be performed against the vector representations of the `problem_name` and `description` from the "1.1 Problems" dataset. This will allow the AI to quickly and accurately identify the most relevant problem category even with varied and informal user language. It will also be used to find semantically similar questions in the "1.2 Self Assessment" sheet to handle more conversational user queries.
  - **Rationale:** Vector databases are specifically designed for efficient similarity searches in high-dimensional data, which is ideal for natural language understanding and semantic search.

- **NoSQL Document Database (e.g., MongoDB, Firestore):**
  - **Use Case:** A NoSQL database is well-suited for storing the structured, yet flexible, conversational flows and knowledge base content. The various "sheets" (Problems, Self Assessment, Suggestions, etc.) can be stored as collections of documents. This will allow for easy retrieval of questions, suggestions, and feedback prompts based on IDs and categories. User conversation history can also be stored in a flexible document format.
  - **Rationale:** NoSQL databases offer flexibility in data structure, which is beneficial for an evolving application. They are highly scalable and can handle the large volumes of text-based data that a chat application will generate.

### **5. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **User Experience (UX):** The app must have a clean, calming, and intuitive user interface. The chat experience should feel natural and responsive.
- **Security & Privacy:** All user data, especially conversation logs, must be encrypted both in transit and at rest. The system must be compliant with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR). User anonymity should be a core principle.
- **Performance:** The AI's responses should be near-instantaneous to maintain a natural conversational flow. App loading times should be minimal.
- **Scalability:** The architecture must be able to support a growing number of users and an expanding knowledge base without degradation in performance. Both the chosen Vector and NoSQL databases are known for their horizontal scalability.
- **Reliability:** The app must be highly available (e.g., 99.9% uptime) to ensure users can access support whenever they need it.

### **6. Future Considerations**

- **Multi-language Support:** The data model and AI should be designed with future multi-language support in mind.
- **Voice Input:** Integration of voice-to-text capabilities to allow users to speak their responses.
- **Mood Tracking:** A dedicated feature for users to track their mood over time, with visualizations to identify patterns.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** A system for trained mental health professionals to review anonymized conversations to improve the AI's responses and identify areas for knowledge base expansion.
- **Escalation to Human Support:** A clear and safe protocol to connect users with human support or crisis hotlines in case of severe distress.
