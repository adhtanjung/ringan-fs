One way to begin restoring a sense of safety is through consistent, calming routines.\\nTry this: Choose a predictable time each day (for example, just after waking or before bed). During this time, take three to five minutes to pause, breathe slowly, and notice your physical environment. Feel your feet on the ground. Pay attention to a color or object in the room. Say to yourself:\\n“I am here right now. I am safe enough in this moment.”\\nOver time, this simple act helps teach the nervous system that not every moment is dangerous. It's okay if this feels strange or difficult at first—reclaiming safety is a gradual process.\\nIf the sense of unsafety feels too overwhelming, please consider reaching out to a trauma-informed therapist who can help you strengthen this skill with support."

It may show up as zoning out, emotional numbness, memory gaps, or a floating feeling—especially in stressful situations. Rather than seeing this as something “wrong,” it’s helpful to view dissociation as your brain’s way of protecting you from overwhelm.\\nBegin by gently noticing when you lose presence. Ask yourself:\\n– What situation was I in when I disconnected?\\n– What was I feeling just before?\\n– What helped bring me back?\\nYou might carry a small object—a stone, piece of fabric, or scent—that you can touch when you're feeling out of body. This helps ground your senses.\\nThis isn’t about forcing yourself to stay present in all moments, but about developing gentle awareness and self-compassion when it happens.\\nIf dissociation becomes distressing or interferes with daily life, therapy can offer safe ways to reconnect with your body and experience."

What tells me I am emotionally safe (no one criticizing me, I can speak freely)? What might help me feel safer in this moment, even a little? You can say these answers out loud or write them down. Over time, this helps your nervous system begin to separate past danger from present safety.

Here’s how it works:\\n– Look around and name 5 things you can see (e.g., your hands, a window, a lamp).\\n– Notice 4 things you can touch (e.g., your shirt, the chair, the floor).\\n– Focus on 3 things you can hear right now (e.g., distant traffic, birds, your own breath).\\n– Identify 2 things you can smell (or recall smells you like if none are present).\\n– Finally, identify 1 thing you can taste (or imagine a favorite flavor).\\nThis method gently brings your attention to your body and environment, helping you feel safer.\\nWhy it helps: Grounding interrupts dissociation and re-regulates the nervous system."

The idea is to notice your anxious thoughts, write them down, and then challenge them gently with evidence. How to do it: (1) Write down the thought — e.g., “Everyone thinks I’m weird when I speak.” (2) Ask yourself: “What evidence do I have for and against this thought?” and “Is there another way to look at this?” (3) Replace it with something more balanced, like: “Some people may not even notice me, and others might appreciate what I say. I’m allowed to speak up.” This helps your brain start seeing social situations more clearly, instead of through an anxiety filter.",
