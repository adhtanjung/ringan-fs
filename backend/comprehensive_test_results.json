It’s like stuffing dirty laundry under your bed — you don’t see it for a while, but eventually it smells and starts affecting your whole room. The truth is that avoiding stress is like pressing “snooze” on an alarm clock. The noise stops for now, but you still need to get up on time and get to school or work. Instead of avoiding, try this: Take one small step toward the stressful thing — even if it’s just writing down what you need to deal with onto a paper. Set a timer for 10 minutes and work on it just a little until the 10 minutes is up. You don’t have to do it all at once. But when you face even a small piece of what’s stressing you, you show yourself that it is doable, in small chunks. Keep taking small steps until you feel  more in control of your needs.",

Try these steps to challenge those thoughts in order to reduce anxiety and increase self-compassion.\nStep 1: Spot All-or-Nothing Thinking:  Perfectionism often shows up as extreme, black-and-white thoughts. For example: “If I make one mistake, I’m a failure.” “I have to get it exactly right or it doesn’t count.”\nStep 2: Replace with Balanced Thoughts: Challenge those extremes and offer yourself a more realistic mindset. For example, Say to yourself:  “I can do my best without being perfect.”  “Mistakes help me learn—they don’t define my worth.”\nStep 3: What Could Go Wrong? — Make a Plan. Perfectionistic habits are tough to break. Plan for common challenges. What Might Go Wrong / What I’ll Do If It Happens\nI obsess over details - Set a time limit and stop when the timer rings\nI avoid starting because it's not perfect - Remind myself: “Done is better than perfect”\nI criticize myself for small errors - Pause and say: “This is growth, not failure”\nI compare myself to others - Unfollow triggering accounts, refocus on my personal progress\nYou don’t have to be perfect to be valuable.

Say to yourself:  “This is just panic. It feels scary, but it’s not dangerous. It will pass, I will feel better in 10 minutes.”\nStep 3: Stay Present and focus on what you can control in the moment—your breath, your posture, or naming things around you.\nStep 4: What usually helps me? What is that one thing that usually helps me in these attacks? \nStep 5: Act on it, try and do one thing as a resistance to the panic feeling.
