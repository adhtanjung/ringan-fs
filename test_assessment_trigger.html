    <h1>Assessment Test</h1>
    <p>Open the browser console and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3001/application/chatbot" target="_blank">http://localhost:3001/application/chatbot</a></p>
    <p>Then send a message like: "I'm feeling very stressed and anxious about work. I can't sleep and feel overwhelmed."</p>
    <p>This should trigger the assessment flow and you should see debug information in the console.</p>
    
    <h2>What to look for in console:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Debug logs showing assessment data structure</li>
        <li>response_type field in the question object</li>
        <li>Whether the 1-10 scale UI appears</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Expected behavior:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After a few exchanges, the system should offer an assessment</li>
        <li>When you accept, you should see assessment questions</li>
        <li>For scale questions, a 1-10 rating interface should appear</li>
    </ul>
